# Examples with Contract Morphisms

This repository houses some examples of using [contract morphisms](../../theories/ContractMorphisms.v) in specification and proof.

-   [specify-upgrade/](specify-upgrade/specify-upgrade.v) is an example of specifying a contract upgrade using contract morphisms
-   [backwards-compatible/](backwards-compatible/backwards-compatible.v) is an example of proving backwards compatibility with contract morphisms 
-   [hoare/](hoare/hoare.v) is an example of transporting a Hoare property of partial correctnes over a contract morphism
-   [upgradeability-decomposition/](upgradeability-decomposition/upgradeability-decomposition.v) is an example of decomposing an upgradeable contract into its mutable and immutable parts using contract morphisms
