TODOs:

For ContractMorphisms:
- [ ] The right definition of surjection 
    - [ ] you want reachable states -> reachable states
- [ ] The lifting theorem 


For ContractSystems:
- [ ] The right definition of direct sum 
- [ ] lists of contracts/contractions of systems
    - [ ] the polymorphism will be prickly; might need to use WeakContracts
- [ ] The inter-chain stuff
    - [ ] prove current, basic definitions/lemmas
