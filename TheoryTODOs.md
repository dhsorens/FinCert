TODOs:

For ContractMorphisms:
- [x] The right definition of surjection 
    - [x] you want reachable states -> reachable states
- [ ] The lifting theorem 
    - [x] correct recursive definition of chain maps 
    - [x] mapping of chain steps
    - [x] mapping of emitted actions
    - [ ] resolve the issue of deployments


For ContractSystems:
- [ ] The right definition of direct sum 
- [ ] lists of contracts/contractions of systems
    - [ ] the polymorphism will be prickly; might need to use WeakContracts
- [ ] The inter-chain stuff
    - [ ] prove current, basic definitions/lemmas 

Generic:
- [ ] Thorough documentation through the whole repository
    - [ ] a tutorial through the examples 
- [ ] Import prev work done on Dexter2, FA2, and FA1.2 contracts; make it so that's a natural place to put future verified contracts, and that this is a natural companion repository to the ConCert core codebase.
